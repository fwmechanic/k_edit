Problem:
  My chosen Windows shell environment is GitForWindows bash.  In this
  environment, constructing [bash] cmdlines using "Windows format" filenames
  provided by K (e.g. from <win0>) is labor-intensive and error-prone.

Possible solutions:

  Implementation of CYPTL ("CYgPath Translation Layer") mimicking the
  functionality of `cygpath` (reinvention of the wheel?  Would rather not).

  When to enable this translation layer?  if $SHELL:match("[/\\]bash.exe$")

  What about shell cmdline param translation?  Ugh, parsing a cmdline would suck.

  What about declaring a bash alias/function cyp() { cygpath "$1" ; } and
  (yes, manually) coding cmdline tokens w/ "$(cyp 'pasted-filename')" ; but
  that's still __A LOT__ of picky TYPING.

  Maybe a new function derivative of lasttext which runs cygpath on the select text?

  But maybe it's better to wait
